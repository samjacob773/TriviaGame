# TriviaGame

The app is currently deployed here: https://samjacob773.github.io/TriviaGame/

Problem: Plenty of people think they know everything there is to know about their favorite show of movie. My favorite show right now is Bob's Burgers, so I designed a quiz suitable only for a truly obsessed fan. 

Solution: Ten multiple choice questions are asked via a trivia form. The app shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.


The app was implemented using: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and Jquery.
